# Wikipedia Viewer - FreeCodeCamp Project
---
## 1. What This Project Does
The purpose of this app is to interface with the Wikipedia API and provide the user with search results and relevant links (or a random link if they choose). This was a good opportunity to work further with APIs, parsing JSON data, and iteratively constructing new DOM elements with said data.

The user stories for this project are:

* The user can search Wikipedia entries in a search box and see the resulting Wikipedia entries.
* The user can click a button to see a random Wikipedia entry.
* Use any libraries or APIs needed, and give it your own personal style.

The originally submitted version of the app fulfilled all user stories, and the various iterations since then have been improvements either in styling or in making the code more succinct.

## 2. How To Set This Up
If you want to clone this project for yourself, the process is very simple due to the structure of the project.

1. Either manually download and unzip files to a location, or clone this repo through Git.
2. Open the index.html file in your browser. This project is built on HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript/jQuery and the necessary resources from Bootstrap and FontAwesome are linked through the HTML file, so there is no need to install any packages through NPM.

## 3. Project Goals
As one of my early web development projects, this was a chance for me to:

* Continue working with HTML/CSS for styling and creating a crisp, visually appealing user experience.
* Practice using jQuery to monitor divs and buttons for clicks and apply appropriate responses to the DOM.
* Get more hands-on experience with querying APIs and parsing JSON data.
* Look for opportunities to use special JavaScript functions like .map, .every, etc to make code more pure and declarative vs imperative.
* Continue producing well-documented code with repetitive functionality factored out into specific functions that minimize redundancy, keep code short, and increase readability/maintainability.

Now that I'm coming back and reviewing past projects (such as this one), my new goals in addition to supporting the previous ones are:

* Redesign the app to fit into my growing design language/styling through color, layout, animations, and reduction of unnecessary elements
* Refactor any redundancies in my JavaScript and make old code compliant with current linters (such as AirBnB's standards)

## 4. Link to Live Site
The latest version of the site can be viewed [here](https://stern-shawn.github.io/FCC-WikipediaViewer/) thanks to gh-pages hosting.

## 5. Roadmap
TODO:

* ~~Establish initial template in plain HTML/CSS, including a search field, search button, and random button~~
* ~~Figure out how to search the Wikipedia API given a search term, and get back a short description/links for up to 10 relevant results... this took awhile to figure out...~~
* ~~Use looping to generate a new result div based on each result and append it to the DOM~~
* ~~Allow the user to enter search results with the enter key instead of always having to click the Go button~~
* Restyle app
* Add animations
